In this article. Failover clustering - a Windows Server feature that enables you to group multiple servers together into a fault-tolerant cluster - provides new and improved features for software-defined datacenter customers and many other workloads running clusters on physical hardware or in virtual machines. A failover cluster is a group. 
According to Microsoft, the company originally introduced Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) in Windows Server 2016 mainly to protect “mission-critical” applications such as its SQL Server database and Microsoft Exchange communications server. 4 апр 2018  (В Windows Server 2012 R2, диск можно подготовить как NTFS или  Failover Clustering Hardware Requirements and Storage Options.

Failover clustering originated as a technology that was designed to protect mission-critical applications such as Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Exchange, but since that time failover clustering has evolved into a high availability platform for a number of different Windows services and applications. Virtual Machine Load Balancing / Node Fairness Динамическая оптимизация, доступная в VMM, частично перекочевала в Windows Server 2016 и предоставляет базовое распределение нагрузки на узлах в автоматическом режиме.

So it's been a year since we switched to Storage Spaces Direct, and I felt it would be a nice time to let everyone know how it's been. I'll start with a background story, and then jump right in. Background : When I took my current position, I walked into a complete mess. The network and servers have been neglected for years by lack of budget and IT know-how to keep things running as they should. I first started looking at everything that could put us out of business, and the first thing. Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2 The Windows Server Cluster Management Pack for Operations Manager is designed for the following versions of System Center Operations Manager: • System Center Operations Manager 2012 • System Center Operations Manager 2012 SP1 • System Center Operations.

I have 25 SQL VMs (total of 25 vCPUs) that run in a cluster of 15 hosts and was just told by our MS licensing rep that we have to license SQL for every potential VM host. So I have to buy 240 2-core SQL licenses. Does that make sense? Should I just setup a two node ESX cluster By default, Windows 2000 and later enable cluster logging. To enable cluster logging on a Windows NT 4.0 server cluster, you must set the following System environment variables: To set the System environment variables, follow these steps: In the System tool in Control Panel, click the Environment. 
Хотя, Windows Server и является “старшим братом” настольных операционных систем, с точки зрения ОЕМ-лицензирования, Windows Server имеет несколько важных отличий. Во-первых, учитывая сложность продукта, лицензия сборщика систем. 22 апр 2013  Некоторые версии Microsoft Windows Server также могут функционировать в качестве цели iSCSI, совместимой со стандартами iSCSI. So with windows server licensing you buy core packs 2 cores at a time (for 2 cpus). If I am running VMware hosts that have 2 CPUs with 10 cores each but I don't assign more than 8 total cores to the Windows virtual machines do I still need to license those 2 unused cores? My assumption is no but getting a clear answer from Microsoft on this is not easy. Thanks. This article describes how to install service packs or hotfixes on a Windows Server failover cluster. Applying a service pack or hotfix to a server cluster is the same as applying a service pack or hotfix to Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2 (although Windows Server 2012 requires a different process). I need to provide visualization like Microsoft Cluster Viewer in R, are there any libraries for this?

Microsoft is really jamming the virtual community with their new licensing model. i.e. License every single core, even if the VM doesn't even use it. amp#x200B; My case: small 4 host cluster, but each with a beefy physical cpu/core count. We have 1 dumb provider who want's a Windows server VM for their application as opposed to the Linux option. We complied, but now to navigate the license nightmare. amp#x200B; I understand the microsoft greedy way to be: Licensing all cores High Availability (Clustering) we have implemented server 2016 node hyper-v cluster  our one node show quarantine we have run start-clusternode cq but the problem is same please help me.

I have created a file share server cluster using Microsoft server 2016, we will call them FS01, and FS02. The cluster uses a shared ISCSI disk on network attached storage called NAS01. NAS01 replicates to NAS02. The operating system of my NAS does not support failover, so I still have one point of failure which is my ISCSI disk. Is there a way to attach the backup ISCSI disk to the cluster and have it automatically fail over to the other. If I have one (1) Windows Server 2016 Std VM on a vSphere cluster of 3 ESXi nodes (each with 2 CPU) do I need to buy a minimum of 6 core licenses to stay in compliance (since the VM can vMotion from host to host to host). I'm in the midst of setting up a new workstation for myself running KDE Neon. Since I admin Windows servers too and since POSH on nix is becoming a thing I just wondering how many admins out there actually Hi, I have a very broken Exchange 2010 server (or two) - all services have been migrated to new exchange environment, but. well, I have conceded I will have to forcefully remove. Anybody happen to have a script for this? (Rather than go through 30 manual steps) Cheers. Hi All, I am looking at replacing some hardware at a site and have a quick question. At present they have 2 node fail over cluster and a management hypervisor which hosts the main DC. amp#x200B; If i implement a Storage Spaces Direct solution with FOC running on there for our VMs, am I safe to run the main DC in the cluster. Looking for a remote VM system for my self hosted network lab. amp#x200B; 'Normally' people use Vmware Esxi but I want to run Linux on the baremetal and run the vm(s) on there. I know about kvm and Vbox Headless (via RDP). Which do you guys recommend for a self-hosted. Hey all. I’ve lurked here for a bit, along with gave some help on builds but wanted to see if I could get your opinion on a potential build. We have a lot of legacy systems, along with a few 24 Bay freenas systems that primarily serve as Dev and Backup storage. Here’s what we’re trying to do: iSCSI datastores for VMware - About 60TB now but could double in two years SMB shares for large user files and data dumps from our processing boxes Using the S3 connector and cloud sync function. I have a Windows 2016 failover cluster with 6 hosts. Each have 2 SSDs and 4 HDDs. Sometimes during Windows update, the server fails to reboot properly. I usually have to manually bring it back online. When it does come back, sometimes a few disks would get into LOST COMMUNICATION status and stay there. Usually, the only way I can bring the disks out of this status is by EVICT the node from the cluster, and then disks would come back online normally. Obviously, there is nothing wrong. 
We were recently working with a vendor who initially told us that Hyper-V was required to run the software, but once we told them that we were running VMware, they said they could work with that. When I told my boss' that they balked at the idea of anyone but "mom n' pops" using Hyper-V in production. I thought this was odd, because I worked as an Army contractor for a while and they used Hyper-V exclusively. They didn't seem very "mom n' pop" to me, but I admit, my experience is limited Hey everyone I have a question about setting up a vSAN (specifically using StarWind right now) in a Hyper-V system. Here is the current config: The system at the moment is Server 2008 R2 running AD:DS, File Server, DHCP, DNS, and Printers. The main issue is that the File Server is on a RAID5 with Seagate Barracuda consumer grade drives, with no hot spare and no backups. This is running in a business with about 40 users that are actively using 500mb-1gb files. My proposed solution: I have a 3 node Hyper-V failover cluster. Should I set up a disk witness quorum? Or does anyone have a good article explaining why or why not I would want disk witness quorum. Hi guys, just seeing if anyone has set up a failover file server like this and if they have had any issues with it. I have 2 storage servers running SOFS that host all VHDX's in my domain. I want to create 2 new file servers hosted on SOFS, create an 800GB shared VHDX between the 2 servers and create file shares on them. Does this seem like the logical setup? Any input on doing it better? Thanks in advance for any replies. 
After several weeks of research and getting quotes from Nutanix, vxrail, nimble, and simplivity, all in the neighborhood of 5k. I also received a quote from Starwind for an all flash 7.2TB (6Gbps SATA) 3 node hyper converged (Hyper-V) appliance for k which includes windows and SQL licenses. I feel this is more than enough to run 5 virtual machines for 25 users todday and maybe 50 users later for a warehouse management system and file sharing. What I would Hi All, What kinds of VM environments do you use or prefer to use on your campuses? Hyper-V? VMWare? ProxMox? Thanks. My DBA team is requesting dedicated esxi hosts for them to run MS SQL on. It's not a large environment, a few hundred employees, and probably 4 SQL servers at about 64GB to 128GB of RAM each (per their request). is this really necessary to have a separate dedicated esxi cluster just to run VM's that run MS SQL, while putting any other VM's (such as a print server, RDS server, etc.) on other esxi hosts within the same Datacenter? To me the request seems political and based on more ignora. Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) is a computer program that allows server computers to work together as a computer cluster, to provide failover and increased. For more information about how to add nodes to or remove nodes from an existing failover cluster instance, see Add or Remove Nodes in a SQL Server Failover Cluster. Note. Either installation option allows for multi-node SQL Server failover cluster installation. Add Node can be used to add additional nodes for either option after. Communication between Server Cluster nodes is critical for smooth cluster operations. Therefore, you must configure the networks that you use for cluster. A local SAS drive may be clustered due to changes in the default behavior of cluster-able disk criteria introduced in Windows Server.
