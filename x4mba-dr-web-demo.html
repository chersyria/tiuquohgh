I'm based in Pittsburgh, PA. tl;dr is that I'm 7 years out of college, haven't practiced my skills outside of work till recently, and my technical skills have atrophied through only doing support work. Current job is a nightmare, I'm desperate to get out, and only now realize that I'm totally out of practice and my lack of ambition has screwed me over. How can I improve my situation? For the full background and context. Graduated

Note that in this topic, I'm not going to take into account solo mode or the different navigation tools the classes have in regards to mining. This is purely in the context of swarm combat in Hazard 5 with a full or nearly full team, with competent teammates and without mission modifiers. Driller's combat abilities are not unusable right now, but are too specialized and situational to be considered to be on the same levels as the other three. As of the current build, there are too many enemie. Упростите вход в Мастер скачиваний. Для этого создайте аккаунт на сайте «Доктор Веб» и заявите свои лицензии в программе лояльности Я + Dr.Web. It is now Plants vs. Zombies' 10th birthday and I am now going to take a nostalgia trip back to when I first heard of Plants vs. Zombies and the day I played it for the very first time. This is a very long story so you can skip some parts if you like. Note: This contains spoilers on PvZ 2. If you haven't played it/completed it, I recommend you to try to skip the spoilers that are mentioned here. I may be a little bit mixed up with the dates and timeline.

Выбор и развертывание нового программного обеспечения, переход на новые версии – одни из самых ответственных задач для любого системного администратора. I posted on here a little while ago asking for help finding the original Clarity Live album booklet. In my memory it included a track by track breakdown of the album. I think that my memory was wrong. I was spurred into searching for the breakdown afresh today.and I found it! This is from an archived page on the band's website and may have been an email campaign to fans. It was published in 2009 for the 10th anniversary of the album. https://web.archive.org/web/2009071620.

I thought this would take a weekend. It took a week. I spent too much time on this I took songs with medleys in their names as well as songs that contains "unadvertised" songs as best as i could. Like Song Of Storms has Ganondorf's Theme and Serenade of Water, but songs like Saria's Song/Middle Boss Battle doesn't count since the secondary song is on the title.

Hi Classic WoW Making a post here to try and summarise all the bugs and legion mechanics in the demo. This is not ment do bash on the Classic Demo, its only ment for constructive feedback. WoW Classic devs wants the community to help point out wrongs, so im making this thread to try and find all of them. But i need your help, so comment down below and i will edit in more bulletpoints in this post. All this information is combined from earlier posts on this subreddit, youtube videos I think people are focusing on the streaming aspect of Stadia, and completely ignored the more important revolutionary features that Google Stadia announced. That is, it has the capability to replace traditional multiplayer game servers as well as offload certain workloads that either our computers or current game servers must deal with today. This alone is game changing for VR. And no, this particular aspect will still work with the millisecond-level input levels that VR requires 
TL;DR is below for anybody that doesn’t want to read the wall of text The year is 2013 and the nostalgia fueled bandwagon is on an all-time high. Before Yooka-Laylee has been announced as a Banjo Kazooie spiritual successor, there was another project that wanted to give people its Collectathon itch. Lobodestroyo vs. La Liga De Los Villages (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lefthanded/lobodestroyo-3d-action-platformer-game) was a Kickstarter that successfully raised 43,381$ Final Fantasy Versus XIII was named specifically as one of the Fabula Nova Crystallis collective titles, there were other games that never made it, including one that was only trademarked and never otherwise announced (see: FINAL FANTASY HAERESIS XIII, which was trademarked internationally and then abandoned by Square-Enix ( There's been quite a lot of misinformation regarding Versus We are moving towards heterogeneous "hyper-net" powered by Artificial Intelligence.

Now that the AMA is over I though a thread with all answered questions would be great - Here are all answers from the AMA: Does the Matrix side chain still utilise the MAN token behind the scenes? I know they have their own tokens but I'm wondering if MAN is still used throughout the side chain? or even at all? > Owen: This is determined on a case-by-case basis. Sidechains have the ability to use both MAN tokens or their own currency to pay for gas. This determination depends TL;DR: The Web3 Foundation says they're building "An internet where users are in control of their own data, identity, and destiny." Polkadot is the Web3 Foundation's main project to fulfill that mission. Polkadot's token holders and a technocratic council control Polkadot's governance. How can users control their data, identities, and destinies when they have no say in governance? Over the last few months I've gotten really excited about Substrate (https://www.parity.io/substrat. The year was 1999. I was in between real jobs and working a seasonal job at a shit toy store at the Grapevine Mills Mall in TX to make ends meet. I generally worked the video game counter because that meant I usually got to goof off and play the demo Playstation when I wasn't opening the glass cases for the customers or checking them out when the main register was too crowded. It was a week or so before Christmas and we had a total run on Gameboy Color systems because a quake in Taiwan created. Hi everyone! I've added lots of stuff below! Have a look and let's trade! For a more detailed list, check out this: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13cnKSF-0HDSKpNHflw6up96qyu-P9ZqcHTlbQHZeUMQ/edit#gid=580250276 I also have a decent size Nintendo Power and GamePro collection.

Low-throughput lab with no automation experience looking to dip our toes in. Hi all, My lab (microbiology/bacterial genetics) is embarking on several high-throughput experiments in the near future and we're considering investing in an automated liquid handler. Our primary need for these projects would be transferring between 96-well plates and gently mixing the contents, performing serial dilutio. 
TL;DR: How do I pass a nonce for script tags to my `index.html` page in react? Webpack? Templating engine? Do I even need to? Hi all, I'm currently learning about the Content Security Policy and am struggling to implement one in a demo react app (without create-react-app). Per Google (https://csp.withgoogle.com/docs/adopting-csp.html), it looks like it's nonce-based or bust at this point, but the documentation on nonce-based CSPs is pretty lacking to begin with, and even worse I have been running a Barracuda Web Security Gateway (WSG) model 615 since 2014 with barely any issues other than a reboot once or twice a year. In January, I got a lovely EOL notice on my dashboard stating March 11 as the last day for the product line. Perfect timing! My budget was approved on January 1 and there is nothing in there for replacing the appliance, just the annual subscription. A year-end notice would have helped. So off I go into content filter world and setup demos/calls. Hi all, Quick background - I am a designer at an engineering-based product design company. I do UX work for both physical (ID) and digital (SW) products, so most of my time is spent in Sketch, SolidWorks, and CC. In my spare time I operate a small music discovery webapp for myself, for fun. I often have no idea what I'm doing so I spend a lot of time learning, expanding, and optimizing the backend scripts. I have basic elementary knowledge in HTML/CSS/JS, and I occasionally (attempt) to write.
